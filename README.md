# Seeker

Seeker is a network utility program used for capturing and analyzing network packets. It's also capable of port scanning, monitoring Internet and Local Area 
Network (LAN) activities. It gathers information about the data passing through your 
Network Interface Card (NIC) and decodes the analyzed data.

Seeker is built with wxPython backend.

## NOTE

This program is still under development. It's still missing some functionalities and you may encounter some bugs. While i'll still work on improving the program overtime, it may not be relied upon for solving heavy networking problems for the time being.
